Hi, my name is Zdenek. I live in Manchester and I am starting new career in coding!<br>

I am huge fan of Badminton. Me and my friends train every other day in local gym!
Coupled with an interest in anything of future technologies and strong passion for music. I aim to turn these hobbies into a successful career that will allow me create amazing things!

My first experiencewith code was at age of 15 years old. My father and I was coding a new cnc maschine. It was simple G code but it sparkle my interest into coding!<br>



Couple weeks ago I started course in CodeAcademy and I am excited to build on what i learnt so far!<br>

I  am originaly from Czech Republic, but I've been living in Manchester for the last 4 years. When I moved to this amazing part of the world, I decided to capture its uniqueness, and I started with my hobby photography.
I always loved nature and a city. Mountains and skyscrapers. They are kind of similar, both awe-inspiring. I focus mostly on these themes, but I like to experiment with other styles as well. Especially long exposure photography.  There are many world famous photographers I admire and take inspiration from. Just to mention some of them:
Michael Kenna - amazing black and white atmospheric landscape images which have soul.

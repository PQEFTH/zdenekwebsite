Unit 2 outcome 1.7
(screen od sefa prevzaty)
Websites are capable of storing data in practically any form, but storing usable data is a different matter and there may be a better way to do it than it first appears. Web pages use the HTML file type and are usually accompanied by a CSS file. Diffetrent libraries can increase the number of filetypes that you can effectively use, but by default it´s a good idea to use.png and .givf for images and .mp4 or .avi for videos.

Since technology is so rapidly changing, its important to pay attention to whatś most commonly used and most supported. For example, Adobe Flash was once extremely popular across the web but it is now no longer being developed and browsers are halting their support for it, so developing and implementing flash content will almost guarantee imminent redundancy.

Unit 1: Improving productivity with IT Unit 1, Outcome 1 

1.0 - Start by writing an ‘about me’ section about your background, why you decided to come to Code Nation and about your experience so far 
(my idea)
DONE

1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business

Businesses utilize IT in a number of different contexts and for many different purposes. For example, telephones, radio equipment and VOIP services used for vocal communications are included under the IT umbrella. In the same way, peripherals such as printers, copiers, scanners and 3D printers are also considered part of a business’ IT systems. Most people think of computers: desktop machines, laptops and mobile devices used by individuals to input and manipulate data, create digital documents, conduct research, and more. In these ways, IT has become critical to the global business community.

1.2 -  Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?  

DODELAT!!!!

1.3 -  Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. 
(my idea)
I will plan my website through trello board. Its useful feature for sorting out KanBan cards. I plan my trello board really well and it just making my work much easier. I can always check what tasks are due and work on them. I do need to use SLACK to communicate with my suppervisor or other handy people for ideas.

1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
So why do projects fail? https://www.manchesterdigital.com/post/manchester-digital/why-digital-projects-fail

muzu pouzit obrazky celkem handy

The most common reasons given for projects to fail were

    Short term priorities taking over
    The initial scope was poorly defined (and the initial strategy / vision was unclear)
    Trying to do too much work all at once
    Silos between marketing and IT

 

However, there are some significant differences in the reasons mainstream businesses give for failures compared to those cited by top performing companies. Mainstream companies are more likely to suffer from planning problems: poor definition, unclear strategy, poor ongoing measurement and lack of alignment in the team. 

1.5  trello, VS code, slack, i chose VS code because of this .... or i was told to use this but i would use another program. all programs are free, if i had some budget i could use some PRO programs (cost)
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/whyvscode
1.5 -  Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
In my first project and rely on my suppervisor and try his way. He reccomend me to use Trello board for planning whole project which was super useful. I used slack for all communications and all worked out well. I would use other communication program probably #XXX(iRc).
I tried for the first time to code in Virtual Studio. It has all the settings, I need to complete my project! 

1.6  related to 1.5.   have to answer different way! git and github we didnt talk about yet... leave it on end of the course.(also reasearch but  not neccesarily) or leave the second part out.
1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
I used Trello board to keep my progress. I spend hours to set-up my Trello board but it was really worthy! I was amazed how easily you can keep track on your progress. There is a loads of features such a labels, due date etc. which will provide everything you need to plan your project.
Virtual Studio was really helpful. It has so many briliant features for beginers. It supports hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation etc. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts! I was really satisfied and I will definitely use VS for my upcoming projects.

1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 
https://www.marketup.cz/cs/blog/dopady-gdpr-na-digitalni-marketing/
Digitální kampaně

Všichni významní provozovatelé reklamních systémů (Google, Seznam, Facebook, Adform, …) deklarují, že do 25.5.2018 budou všechny jejich reklamní systémy plně v souladu s novým nařízením GDPR pro ochranu osobních údajů. Prakticky pro všechny typy kampaní je třeba mít na webu minimálně „cookies lištu“, prostřednictvím které budete informovat uživatele o tom, že využíváte jejich osobní údaje (v tomto případě cookies) pro vyhodnocování reklamy.

Různé právní výklady zatím panují pro oblast remarketingu a cílení reklam na základě chování jednotlivých uživatelů na internetu. Jedny tvrdí, že uživatele stačí pouze informovat o tom, že při návštěvě webu je vyhodnocováno jeho chování, které je následně využíváno pro cílení reklamy. Jiné uvádí, že je třeba získat jeho aktivní souhlas, bez kterého není možné takové taktiky použít. O posunu v této oblasti vás budeme informovat v dalším pokračování článku. Se všemi hlavními provozovateli digitální reklamy uvedenými výše o této problematice intenzivně komunikujeme.

GDPR ještě zasahuje do digitálních kampaní, které využívají data o jednotlivých uživatelích (emaily, telefonní čísla, adresy a další identifikátory) pro cílení prostřednictvím tzv. „Customer match“ mechanismu. Zjednodušeně se jedná o taktiku, v rámci které do reklamního systému (Google Adwords, Facebook, ..) importujeme databázi s identifikátory jednotlivých uživatelů, systém tuto databázi porovná s informacemi, které má k dispozici a uživatelům, které dokáže spárovat, zobrazuje reklamu. Pro tento typ využití osobních údajů je nezbytné mít souhlas podobně jako pro email marketing.

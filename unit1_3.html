        3.1 Review the beneﬁts and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe this project was better as a solo project because it wasnt big project but If we have to create more complicated website it would be better in teams. We could divide all our tasks through Trello board, comunicate on Zoom and Slack. Help each other with problems and sharing ideas.  That would definetely make some improvement to the website.
    </p>
    <p class="Questions_h2">
        3.2  Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a lot of ways to improve productivity and efficiency. In Code Academy course We have lot of activities to keep our interest. Yoga is my personal favorite way to improve my productivity, it´s always good to strech after or before long day in front of computer. We had lot of opportunities to be part of opportunity pledger talks which was very inspiring. I always forgeting to take a break but It does improve your efficiency and productivity and I reccoment to always take few breaks over a day.

    <p class="Questions_h2">
        3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? 
    </p>
    <p>
        I think that working in team is way more productive then working solo. As our first project we had to create a game using python. We planned all together and we solve lot of problems even before we started coding. Throwing ideas on other people and hear feedback is briliant and it´s the best way how to succeed. <br>
        In next project I wanna find out more about Slack and Virtual studio Code. I like to use Trello even more. It has so many more features I didnt have a chance to try out. 
    </p>   
    <p class="Questions_h2">
        3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    </p>

    <p>
        I would use Slack for my testing digital solutions. We used it for our previous project in python. We shared our game code on Slack and other people was testing it and gave us really good feedback. I think without the feedback we would spent hoursIt helped us to overcome some design mistakes and a lot of errors in our game. we moved forward way faster. It was great tool!

    <p class="Questions_h2">2.1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites

    </p> <br><br>
    <p>
    The law in the U.K. is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. It is similar to the U.S. law in that it protects original creations involving literary work, music, art, film, and sound.

    A supplemental law, the Copyright Regulations 1992 extends protection to software, which is normally protected under laws and agencies unique from copyright.

    Works are protected upon creation, meaning as soon as you post your website, you enjoy copyright protection. However, the U.K. Copyright Service highly recommends registration because websites are subject to abuse and that process allows a civil cause of action.

    2.1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them

    I found this reasoning enlightening. I had taken the knowledge of how blind users navigate the web for granted assumed it was mainstream. But the truth is, it isn’t, not for sighted people — a demographic that is heavily involved in product design and development. And this gap is rarely breached during user research. We tend to skip the visually impaired demographic during research except when the product is explicitly made for them.<br>
    In my search to provide a well rounded answer to the question, I watched lots of videos of blind people using navigating the web.<br>
    Screen readers are text to speech softwares in computers that read out the content of web pages to visually impaired users.
    Navigation is done using the keyboard<br>

    Unlike sighted people who mainly navigate the contents of a website with mouses and trackpads, visually impaired people rely on keyboards to navigate contents of a web page.

    2.1.7 Describe which are the appropriate ﬁletypes for website
    </p><br>
    <p>
    Websites are capable of storing data in any form, but storing usable data is a different matter and there may be a better way to do it than it first appears. Web pages use the HTML file type and usually are followed by a CSS file. It´s a good idea to use.png and .jpg for images and .mp4 or .avi for videos.<br>
        
    Since technology is so rapidly changing, its important to pay attention to what´s most commonly used and most supported. For example, Adobe Flash was once extremely popular across the web but it is now no longer being developed and browsers are halting their support for it, so developing and implementing flash content will almost guarantee imminent redundancy.

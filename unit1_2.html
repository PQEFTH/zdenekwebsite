    2.1
    Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code<br>
</p>
  <p>
    Trello helped me to be everything well organized and helped me with time management as well. It´s an easy to use, flexible and fun project management tool. I will be using it to keep everything organized in my future projects. 
    Virtual Studio Code is user friendly program for beginers. It helped me to overcome all difficulties. I would reccomend to use it for all kind of laguages.
    For communication I choose Slack, It´s simple and nice program however I didn´t used it much for this project.

  <p class="Questions_h2">
    2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello<br> <br>
  </p>
I would use Trello for my upcoming projects. You can make as many personal boards, cards, and lists as you want.<br>
It use Kanban method for organizing, tracking, and managing work. To manage a to-do list using a label, notes and more.  
Accessible from a desktop browser, Trello also provides you with free Android and iOS apps, lending to greater flexibility. You can manage your projects in the office, field, or anywhere you are internet-connected because your data is safely backed up in the cloud. I am sure that Trello was good choice for organizing my project.

  2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your ﬁnal project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? <br><br>
  <p>
  I regret that we didnt have more time to find out more about java I would really like to use java in my next project! We were very limited by time and I didn´t implement everything I wanted. I could work more on details and I would change color theme with more readable font. I think that as my first project I was succesful and I was able to create complex website without errors.

    2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project  <br><br></p>
    <p>
    In the future I have to make more details will to improve my website. It lack a bit of Formating and I think it could be more "eye sensitive"  I would like to use java but We dont have time to learn java in this project. Java would make my website much nicer and it has so many more features.  I am looking forward to learn more about JAVA! It lack a bit of Formating and I think it could be more "eye sensitive".

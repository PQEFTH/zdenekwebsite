    1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
    </p>
    <p>
    Businesses utilize IT in a number of different contexts and for many different purposes. For example, telephones, radio equipment and VOIP services used for vocal communications are included. In the same way, peripherals such as printers, copiers, scanners and 3D printers are also considered part of a business’ IT systems. Most people think of computers: desktop machines, laptops and mobile devices used by individuals to input and manipulate data, create digital documents, conduct research, and more. In these ways, IT has become critical to the global business community.<a href="reference.html"> [1]</a>

        1.2 -  Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Plan of upcoming work, estimating tasks to perform, allocating resources, providing and getting feedback from the team, and monitoring quality and deadlines.
        Project managment-dividing project work into short sprints, using adaptive planning and continual improvement.<br>
        Organizing Workflow & Planning- There is a lot of programs that help you to organize everything you need. I chose draw.io. 
        When allocating resources and planning for future, it’s crucial to know who on the team is available for specific dates. Use scheduling software for that!

        1.3 -  Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I plan my website on trello board. It´s useful feature for sorting out KanBan cards and it makes my work much easier.It has so many features to keep your work organizes such a labels, due date, calendar etc. I can always check what tasks are due and work on them. I do need to use SLACK to communicate with other people for ideas.

        1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? 
        So why do projects fail? 
    </p>
    <p>
    Lack of Proper Planning

    Techies are fast paced people – may be that is why they tend to jump in and get things started right away. There can be multiple explanations for this attitude; however, the result of the behaviour is same – absence or lack of proper planning for the projects.

    Poor Communication

    Poor communication is yet another common reason of IT project failure. This problem can also be linked to the lack of project management. Effective and efficient communication with stakeholders, management and the project team is vital for success of a project.

    Little Testing or Skipping the Testing Phase

    Some team leads for the IT projects are under the wrong impression that development tasks are major for the success of projects. This is not true. Each phase of software development is equally important. Your software product can utterly fail if you skip the testing phase or keep it for the end.

    1.5 -  Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? 
    </p>
    <p>
    In my first project and rely software provided by CodeAcademy. I useD Trello board for planning whole project which was super useful. I used slack for communications with no problem. In future I would personaly use other communication program probably iRc.
    I tried for the first time to code in Virtual Studio Code. It has so many features for beginers  and meet all I need to complete my project so far! 
    </p><br>
    <p class="Questions_h2">
        

    1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
    </p>
    <p>
    I used Trello board to keep my progress.! I was amazed how easily you can keep track on your progress. There is a loads of features such a labels, due date etc. which will provide everything you need to plan your project.
    Virtual Studio was really helpful. It has so many briliant features for beginers. It supports hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation etc. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts! I was really satisfied and I will definitely use VS for my upcoming projects.
    I didnt used much git or GitHub for this project but I think It´s useful for control. You can share code  for better feedback.

    1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? 
    </p>
    <p>
     

    Over the past two years, two major regulations have had a widespread impact on digital marketers – GDPR and CCPA.
    GDPR legislation around data privacy and protection was adopted in April 2016. <a href="reference.html">[2]</a> <br>

    Data governance<br>

    In situations like new contact data record creation, or where contacts provided by a third party are being added or integrated into a database, opt-in compliance is again imperative. Managing and handling this across multiple areas such a importing contacts from a spreadsheet, adding a contact from a business card, integrating Sales Navigator contacts with your CRM may be the most complex part of compliance here.<br>

    The penalties for non-compliance with GDPR are set to be significant and could be up to €20 million, or 4% of an organisation’s annual turnover - whichever is greater.<br>
